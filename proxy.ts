// know the user's role, because proxy runs on every request (including
// prefetches) and must not touch the data layer.
//
// Real enforcement lives in requireCoach() / requireClient() in lib/auth.ts,
// called by every protected page and every server action. If this file were
// deleted the app would still be secure — it would just show a flash of a
// protected route before redirecting. Never move an authorization decision
